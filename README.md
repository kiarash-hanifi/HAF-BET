# HAF-BET Code
This repository contains all the code and data required to reproduce the results presented in the paper:
“Application of the Alinaghipour–Falamaki-BET Theory to Mesoporous Materials of Any Nature: Algorithm and Computational Code.”

The algorithms and computational framework were originally developed by Kiarash Hanifi and Cavus Falamaki.
The HAF-BET code can be run in both Octave and MATLAB to calculate the specific surface areas (SSA) and surface energy parameters of mesoporous materials.

## Inputs and Outputs 
Input:  desorption isotherm
Output: specific surface area (SSA), surface energy parameter (C) 

## How to Run
1.
